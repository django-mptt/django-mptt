            Instances not in the queryset will not be retrieved using the

    Notes:
        Takes a list/queryset of model objects in MPTT (ordered by depth ASC)
        and caches the children and parent of every node. This allows up and down
        traversal through the tree without the need for further queries. Use cases
        include using a recursively included template or arbitrarily traversing
        trees.
        Any instance which has no parent in the provided queryset will be added
        to the top nodes list.
        For it to return proper results, queryset _must_ be ordered by ascending
        level.
    Returns:
        A list of top-level nodes, one node per tree root.

        Aliases to this function are also available:

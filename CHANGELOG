=====================
Django MPTT CHANGELOG
=====================

Wed 2nd Jan, 2008
-----------------

* Fixed a bug in ``TreeManager.move_within_tree`` - it now takes into
  account whether or not the new parent's right value is greater than
  that of the node which is being moved.

* Added tests for manually moving nodes using the ``TreeManager``
  methods.

* Extracted logic for moving a ``Model`` instance to a different parent
  within its current tree from ``mptt.signals.pre_save`` into the
  ``move_within_tree`` method in ``TreeManager``.

* Extracted logic for moving a ``Model`` instance from one tree to
  another from ``mptt.signals.pre_save`` into the ``move_to_new_tree``
  method in ``TreeManager``.

* Extracted some similar move-node-to-tree queries in ``TreeManager``'s
  ``make_child_node`` and ``make_root_node`` methods out into a new
  ``_inter_tree_move`` method.

Tue 1st Jan, 2008
-----------------

* Extracted logic for turning a ``Model`` instance which is the root
  node of a tree into a child of a given parent node in another tree from
  ``mptt.signals.pre_save`` into the ``make_child_node`` method in
  ``TreeManager``.

* Extracted logic for turning a ``Model`` instance which is a child node
  into the root node of a new tree from ``mptt.signals.pre_save`` into
  the ``make_root_node`` method in ``TreeManager``.

* Removed ``mptt.signals._get_next_tree_id``; added a
  ``get_next_tree_id`` method to ``TreeManager`` to replace it.

* Extracted some similar space-management queries out into the
  ``close_gap`` and ``create_space`` methods in ``TreeManager``.

* Implemented reparenting when a child node is assigned a different
  parent in the same tree.

* Implemented reparenting when a child node is assigned a parent in a
  different tree.

Mon 31st Dec, 2007
------------------

* Implemented reparenting when a root node is transformed into a child
  node by being assigned a parent.

Sun 30th Dec, 2007
------------------

* Implemented reparenting when a model instance is transformed into a
  root node by having its parent removed.

* Added tests for creation, model instance methods and deletion.

* Added a ``get_siblings`` method to model instances.

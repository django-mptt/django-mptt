Trunk Changes
=============

Fri 4th Jan, 2008
-----------------

* Made ``InvalidMove`` exceptions more granular - they now report on an
  invalid move was attempted with the target node itself or with one of
  its descendants.

* Started implementing moving of nodes to be siblings of roots. This is
  a special case due to our use of a tree id, so it's dealt with in
  ``move_node``.

  As a result, no other node movement implementation methods have to
  check for this special case - they can be sure they'll never have to
  handle a root sibling move, as ``move_node`` will never give them one
  to deal with.

* Simplified the node movement API - ``move_node`` is now the only
  public means of moving a node, as it can figure out what to do based
  on the node and target it's given.

  This simplifies implementation somewhat, as the methods which actually
  do the moving can trust their caller with the arguments which were
  given.

* Added ``is_root_node`` and ``is_child_node`` methods to ``Model``
  instances.

Version 0.1
===========

Packaged from revision 37 in Subversion.

Fri 4th Jan, 2008
-----------------

* Added a ``tree_info`` template filter and a ``full_tree_for_model``
  template tag.

Thu 3rd Jan, 2008
-----------------

* Updated documentation with latest changes, a high level overview of
  features and more details about node movement. Moved detailed
  information about MPTT setup internals to the end of the document.

* Reworked exceptions - ``InvalidMove`` is now raised when an invalid
  move is attempted.

* Added a ``move_to`` convenience method to ``Model`` instances.

* Implemented the ``position`` argument for ``make_child_node`` and
  ``move_node`` in ``TreeManager``. The node movement API can now be
  used to move any node to an arbitrary point in any tree.

* Implemented the ``position`` argument for
  ``TreeManager.move_to_new_tree``.

* Implemented a ``position`` argument for
  ``TreeManager.move_within_tree``. The node being moved can now be made
  a sibling, first child or last child of the target node.

* Added a ``move_node`` method to ``TreeManager``, to take care of
  automatically calling the appropriate node movement manager method.

* Combined a number of SQL queries into single queries using ``CASE``
  operators to reduce the overall number of queries required to move
  tree nodes around.

Wed 2nd Jan, 2008
-----------------

* Fixed a bug in ``TreeManager.move_within_tree`` when no level change
  is required.

* Fixed a bug in ``TreeManager.move_within_tree`` - it now takes into
  account whether or not the new parent's right value is greater than
  that of the node which is being moved.

* Added tests for manually moving nodes using the ``TreeManager``
  methods.

* Extracted logic for moving a ``Model`` instance to a different parent
  within its current tree from ``mptt.signals.pre_save`` into the
  ``move_within_tree`` method in ``TreeManager``.

* Extracted logic for moving a ``Model`` instance from one tree to
  another from ``mptt.signals.pre_save`` into the ``move_to_new_tree``
  method in ``TreeManager``.

* Extracted some similar move-node-to-tree queries in ``TreeManager``'s
  ``make_child_node`` and ``make_root_node`` methods out into a new
  ``_inter_tree_move`` method.

Tue 1st Jan, 2008
-----------------

* Extracted logic for turning a ``Model`` instance which is the root
  node of a tree into a child of a given parent node in another tree from
  ``mptt.signals.pre_save`` into the ``make_child_node`` method in
  ``TreeManager``.

* Extracted logic for turning a ``Model`` instance which is a child node
  into the root node of a new tree from ``mptt.signals.pre_save`` into
  the ``make_root_node`` method in ``TreeManager``.

* Removed ``mptt.signals._get_next_tree_id``; added a
  ``get_next_tree_id`` method to ``TreeManager`` to replace it.

* Extracted some similar space-management queries out into the
  ``close_gap`` and ``create_space`` methods in ``TreeManager``.

* Implemented reparenting when a child node is assigned a different
  parent in the same tree.

* Implemented reparenting when a child node is assigned a parent in a
  different tree.

Mon 31st Dec, 2007
------------------

* Implemented reparenting when a root node is transformed into a child
  node by being assigned a parent.

Sun 30th Dec, 2007
------------------

* Implemented reparenting when a ``Model`` instance is transformed into
  a root node by having its parent removed.

* Added tests for creation, ``Model`` instance methods and deletion.

* Added a ``get_siblings`` method to ``Model`` instances.

Development version
===================

Alternatively, you can get the latest source from our `git`_ repository::

   git clone git://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt.git django-mptt

Add the resulting folder to your `PYTHONPATH`_ or symlink the ``mptt`` directory
inside it into a directory which is on your PYTHONPATH, such as your Python 
installation's ``site-packages`` directory.

You can verify that the application is available on your PYTHONPATH by
opening a Python interpreter and entering the following commands::

   >>> import mptt
   >>> mptt.VERSION
   (0, 5, 2)

When you want to update your copy of the source code, run ``git pull``
from within the ``django-mptt`` directory.

.. caution::

   The development version may contain bugs which are not present in the
   release version and introduce backwards-incompatible changes.

   If you're tracking master, keep an eye on the recent `Commit History`_ 
   before you update your copy of the source code.

Upgrade Notes - 0.3 to 0.4
==========================


Model changes in 0.4
====================

``mptt.register`` replaced by ``MPTTModel``
-------------------------------------------

In ``django-mptt`` 0.4, mptt.register() has been removed in favour of model inheritance.

Suppose you start with this, which works with ``django-mptt`` 0.3::

    class Node(models.Model):
        ...
    
    mptt.register(Node, order_insertion_by=['name'], parent_attr='padre')


First, Make your model a subclass of ``MPTTModel``, instead of ``models.Model``::

    from mptt.models import MPTTModel
    
    class Node(MPTTModel):
        ...

Then remove your call to ``mptt.register()``. If you were passing it keyword arguments, you should add them to an ``MPTTMeta`` inner class on the model::

    class Node(MPTTModel):
        ...
        class MPTTMeta:
            order_insertion_by = ['name']
            parent_attr = 'padre'

MPTT attributes on ``MyModel._meta`` deprecated, moved to ``MyModel._mptt_meta``
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most people won't need to worry about this, but if you're using any of the following, note that these are deprecated and will be removed in 0.5::

    MyModel._meta.left_attr
    MyModel._meta.right_attr
    MyModel._meta.tree_id_attr
    MyModel._meta.level_attr
    MyModel._meta.tree_manager_attr
    MyModel._meta.parent_attr
    MyModel._meta.order_insertion_by

They'll continue to work as previously for now, but you should upgrade your code if you can. Simply replace ``_meta`` with ``_mptt_meta``.


You're probably all upgraded at this point :) A couple more notes for more complex scenarios:


More complicated scenarios
==========================

What if I'm already inheriting from something?
----------------------------------------------

If your model is already a subclass of an abstract model, you should use multiple inheritance::

    class Node(MPTTModel, ParentModel):
        ...

You should always put MPTTModel as the first model base. This is because there's some
complicated metaclass stuff going on behind the scenes, and if Django's model metaclass
gets called before the MPTT one, strange things can happen.

Isn't multiple inheritance evil? Well, maybe. However, the 
`Django model docs`_ don't forbid this, and as long as your other model doesn't have conflicting methods, it should be fine.

.. note::
   As always when dealing with multiple inheritance, approach with a bit of caution.
   
   Our brief testing says it works, but if you find that the Django internals are somehow
   breaking this approach for you, please `create an issue`_ with specifics.

Writing reusable apps - Compatibility with 0.3 as well
------------------------------------------------------

If you're writing a library or reusable app that needs to work with older versions of django-mptt,
you'll need to update your code to handle both versions.

Here's a sample models file which works with 0.3 and 0.4::

    from django.db import models

    import mptt
    try:
        from mptt.models import MPTTModel
    except ImportError:
        # django-mptt < 0.4
        MPTTModel = models.Model

    class Node(MPTTModel):
        name   = models.CharField(max_length=20, blank=True)
        parent = models.ForeignKey('self', null=True, blank=True, related_name='children')
        
        class MPTTMeta:
            order_insertion_by = 'name'

    if hasattr(mptt, 'register'):
        # django-mptt < 0.4
        # This line looks frightening, suggestions for alternatives welcome :)
        mptt.register(Node, **dict([(attr, getattr(Node.MPTTMeta, attr)) for attr in dir(Node.MPTTMeta) if attr[:1] != '_']))

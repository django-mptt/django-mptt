Django MPTT

Utilities for implementing Modified Preorder Tree Traversal (MPTT) with
your `Django`_ ``Model`` classes and working with trees of ``Model``
instances.

Setting up a ``Model`` class for MPTT
-------------------------------------

The ``mptt.models`` module contains a ``treeify`` function, which users
can call to set a ``Model`` class up for MPTT. This function takes as
its arguments the ``Model`` class itself and attribute names for certain
fields which are required in order to manage the database table for the
``Model`` as a tree.

The following argument is required:

* ``cls`` -- the ``Model`` class which is to be set up for MPTT.

All remaining arguments are optional, but you should take care to
specify appropriate attribute names where the default attribute names
do not fit with your ``Model`` class' definition:

* ``parent_attr`` -- the name of an attribute which relates the
  ``Model`` back to itself such that each instance can be a child of
  another instance. Defaults to ``'parent'``.

  Users are responsible for setting this field up on the model class,
  which can be done like so::

     parent = models.ForeignKey('self', null=True, blank=True, related_name='children')

For the following four arguments, if fields with the given attribute
names do not exist, they will be added to the ``Model`` class
dynamically:

* ``left_attr`` -- the name of an attribute which contains the left tree
  node edge indicator, which should be a ``PositiveIntegerField``.
  Defaults to ``'lft'``.

* ``right_attr`` -- the name of an attribute which contains the right
  tree node edge indicator, which should be a ``PositiveIntegerField``.
  Defaults to ``'rght'``.

* ``tree_id_attr`` -- the name of an attribute which contains the tree
  id, which should be a ``PositiveIntegerField``. Defaults to
  ``'tree_id'``.

  Items which do not have a parent are considered to be "root" nodes in
  the tree and will be allocated a new tree id. All descendants of root
  nodes will be given the same tree id as their root node.

* ``level_attr`` -- the name of an attribute which contains the
  (zero-based) level at which an item sits in the tree, which should be
  a ``PositiveIntegerField``. Defaults to ``'level'``.

  For example, root nodes would have a level of ``0`` and their
  immediate children would have have a level of ``1``.

* ``tree_manager_attr`` -- the name of an attribute which should
  reference a custom ``Manager`` which handles working with trees of
  ``Model`` instances. Defaults to ``'tree'``.

.. _`minimal example usage`:

Mimimal example usage is given below, where the ``Model`` class being
set up for MPTT is suitable for use with the default arguments of
``treeify``::

   from django.db import models

   from mptt.models import treeify

   class Genre(models.Model):
       name = models.CharField(max_length=50, unique=True)
       parent = models.ForeignKey('self', null=True, blank=True, related_name='children')

MPTT setup details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps are taken when ``treeify`` is called to set up a
``Model`` class for MPTT:

1. If the ``Model`` class does not have fields defined with names
   matching any of the attribute names given for the ``left_attr``,
   ``right_attr``, ``tree_id_attr`` or ``level_attr`` arguments, the
   following field is dynamically added to the model for each missing
   field::

      models.PositiveIntegerField(db_index=True, editable=False)

   As such, if all of these fields are left to be dynamically added, the
   tree structure is effectively invisible to the
   ``django.contrib.admin`` application and any ``newforms`` forms
   generated using the ``ModelForm`` class, if these are being used with
   the ``Model`` in question.

2. Signal receiving functions are registered for the built-in
   ``pre_save`` and ``pre_delete`` signals which are fired when a
   ``Model`` instance is about to be saved or deleted, respectively.

   These functions take care of managing MPTT fields when a ``Model``
   instance is about to be created or deleted.

3. Additional instance methods are added to the ``Model`` class to
   retrieve information related to ``Model`` instances, based on the
   tree structure.

   See `additional instance methods`_ below for details about the new
   methods which are available.

4. A custom ``Manager`` is added to the ``Model`` class to handle
   working with the tree of model instances. The ``tree_manager_attr``
   argument defines the attribute this manager will be publicly
   accessible via.

   A ``_tree_manager`` attribute is also set up to access this manager,
   for internal use by Django MPTT.

   See `the TreeManager custom Manager`_ below for details about
   the operations available on this custom ``Manager``.

Dynamic field creation vs. Explicitly defining MPTT fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the `minimal example usage`_ above demonstrates, ``Model`` classes
which do not have any field names which clash with the default arguments
to the ``treeify`` function need not contain any details about MPTT
fields at all in their class definition.

One of the goals of this application is that authors should not have to
worry about or use MPTT fields directly in order to reap the benefits of
the functionality their existence enables.

While dynamically added MPTT fields can be used in inner ``Meta`` and
``Admin`` classes, it is recommended that models in which these fields
will be used elsewhere in the class definition should implement the
fields themselves for clarity - it's already bad enough that we're
dynamically adding fields without your model definitions using fields
which don't appear to exist.

Salt to taste, your mileage may vary, etc. etc.

Additional instance methods
---------------------------

The following instance methods will be available on all instances of
``Model`` classes set up for MPTT:

* ``get_ancestors(ascending=False)`` -- creates a ``QuerySet``
  containing all the ancestors of the model instance.

  These default to being in descending order (root ancestor first,
  immediate parent last); passing ``True`` for the ``ascending``
  argument will reverse the ordering (immediate parent first, root
  ancestor last).

* ``get_descendants(include_self=False)`` -- creates a ``QuerySet``
  containing descendants of the model instance.

  If ``include_self`` is ``True``, the ``QuerySet`` will also include
  the model instance itself.

* ``get_descendant_count()`` -- returns the number of descendants the
  model instance has, based on its left and right tree node edge
  indicators. As such, this does not incur any database access.

* ``get_siblings(include_self=False)`` -- creates a ``QuerySet``
  containing siblings of the model instance. Root nodes are considered
  to be siblings of other root nodes.

  If ``include_self`` is ``True``, the ``QuerySet`` will also include
  the model instance itself.

The ``TreeManager`` custom ``Manager``
--------------------------------------

This manager redefines the ``get_query_set`` method, such that the
contents of any ``QuerySet`` created using it will be ordered based on
the tree structure, with trees appearing in the order they were created
and their items being ordered in a depth-first fashion within each tree.

The following tree management methods are available:

* ``close_gap(size, target, tree_id)`` -- closes a gap of a certain size
  after the given target point (a left or right value) in the tree with
  the given id.

* ``create_space(size, target, tree_id)`` -- creates a space of a
  certain size after the given target point (a left or right value) in
  the tree with the given id.

* ``get_next_tree_id()`` -- determines the next available tree id for
  the ``Model`` being managed.

* ``make_child_node(root, target, position='last-child)`` -- moves
  ``node`` (which must be a root node) to a different tree, inserting it
  relative to the given ``target`` node in the new tree as specified by
  ``position``.

* ``make_root_node(node)`` -- removes ``node`` from its tree, making it
  the root node of a new tree.

* ``move_node(node, target, position='last-child')`` -- moves ``node``
  based on ``target``, relative to ``position`` when appropriate, taking
  care of calling the correct manager method to do so.

  A ``target`` of ``None`` indicates that ``node`` should be
  turned into a root node.

  The given ``node`` will be modified to reflect its new tree state in
  the database.

* ``move_to_new_tree(node, target, position='last-child')`` -- moves
  ``node`` to a different tree, inserting it relative to the given
  ``target`` node in the new tree as specified by ``position``.

* ``move_within_tree(node, target, position='last-child')`` --
  moves ``node`` within its current tree, relative to the given
  ``target`` node as specified by ``position``.

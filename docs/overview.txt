What is Modified Preorder Tree Traversal?
=========================================

MPTT is a technique for storing hierarchical data in a database in a
manner which makes tree retrieval operations such as fetching complete
trees, item ancestors and item descendants very efficient.

The trade-off for this efficiency is that performing inserts and moving
items around the tree is more involved, as there's some extra work
required to keep the tree structure in a good state at all times.

Here are a few articles about MPTT to whet your appetite and provide
details about how the technique itself works:

    * `Trees in SQL`_
    * `Storing Hierarchical Data in a Database`_
    * `Managing Hierarchical Data in MySQL`_

In particular, these articles should help you understand the two most
important fields in MPTT - the left and right "edge indicators". Other
fields involved in Django MPTT's implementation of the technique are
discusssed in the technical details documentation.

What is Django MPTT?
====================

Django MPTT is a reusable/standalone Django application which aims to
make it easy for you to use Modified Preorder Tree Traversal with your
own Django models in your own applications.

It takes care of the details of managing a database table as a tree
structure and provides tools for working with trees of model instances.

Feature overview
----------------

* Simple registration of Django model classes for MPTT - fields required
  specifically for the tree structure will be added dynamically if
  necessary.

  In the simplest case, it's possible to use MPTT with your own models
  without adding a single line of MPTT-related code to them.

* The tree structure is automatically managed when you create or delete
  MPTT model instances. By default, new instances are added as the last
  child of their parent if they have one, otherwise they become the root
  of a new tree.

* The tree structure is automatically updated when you change a
  model instance's parent - by default, modified instances are moved so
  they are the last child of their new parent.

  This allows basic management of the tree using the parent field
  available to you in the ``django.contrib.admin`` application and in
  ``django.forms`` forms generated using the ``ModelForm`` class.

* To override the default insertion/reparenting positions mentioned
  above, you can specify that a particular field in your model is used
  for ordering when inserting or automatically reparenting model
  instances.

  This allows you to have each level of the tree automatically sorted by
  a field of your choice.

* New methods are added model classes which are registered with MTTP,
  for changing their position in the tree, retrieving their ancestors,
  siblings and descendants, determining the number of descendants they
  have and other tree-related operations.

* A custom ``TreeManager`` manager is added to all MPTT model classes,
  providing tree management operations which, among other things, can be
  used to move any node in a tree (and its descendants) to an arbitrary
  point elsewhere in the tree, or to insert new nodes at any point in
  the tree.

* ``django.forms`` components for working with trees in forms.

* Utility functions for working with trees of models.

* Template tags and filters for working with trees of models in
  templates.
